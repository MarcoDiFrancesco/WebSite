## Things to do/avoid
Avoid killset (with proficency levels, like bars).

Add website page for a specific project just in case there isn't a specific page dedicated to it, so if I make a website and it has its own page, don't make another page just to explain it.

Avoid to add social links to Facebook, Instagram and keep serpated the website and linkedin.

Add papers (articles) just if they are related to software development.

Avoid to show resume in the first page, so add before projects and in another page resume.

Main links to add:
- Github
- Linkedin
- Resume

Links to avoid:
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Stack overflow (it isn't useful to know the problems I have while programming)

Don't put location in the description, just in the bottom.



# Projects page (if it exists)
Split page in two. In the left part put picture and in the right part the text.

# Resume
Add in the top clickable link to Linkedin and Github.
Add experience.
Add projects (the best 3).
Don't put dates on education (like school and university), just write I've graduated.
Don't write the word internship, just what I've done there.

# Redirecs
Set up social redirects
