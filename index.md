Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science student at Aalto University expecting to graduate in Sep 2024. My journey in Data Science started 4 years ago, where I initlially worked on Computer Vision models for biomedicine, and later specialized in Online Learning algorithms. I'm always courious and very open to learn new Data Science technologies to broaden my experience in this field.
