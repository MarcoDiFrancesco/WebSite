## Things to do/avoid
Avoid killset (with proficency levels, like bars)

Add website page for a specific project just in case there isn't a specific page dedicated to it, so if I make a website and it has its own page, don't make another page just to explain it.

Don't add social links to Facebook, Instagram and keep serpated the website and linkedin.
