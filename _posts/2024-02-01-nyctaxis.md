- Analyzed taxi tipping behavior using Apache Spark to process large-scale datasets (67 GB of Yellow Taxi trip) to assess the impact of ride area, time, distance, and traffic on tipping.
- Employed Spark for data aggregation and analysis, generating insights into spatial and temporal patterns of taxi rides and their correlation with tipping trends.
- Visualized findings using Python libraries (Matplotlib and Seaborn), creating heatmaps and time-series graphs to depict variations in tipping across different NYC zones and times of the day.
