# My portfolio
[https://marcodifrancesco.com](https://marcodifrancesco.com)

The portfolio is constantly (hopefully) updated with all the projects I've made in the last years.

## Execute

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

## Build
As of Dec 2021 github pages uses jekyll 3.9 which uses ruby 2.7, so this github package is not used for local development, instead it's using the package.
