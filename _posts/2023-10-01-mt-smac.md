- Implemented improvements to a multi-target Hyperparameter Optimization model, extending and enhancing the work of a PhD project.
- The project, known as MT-SMAC, focuses on the Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC) for optimizing highly parameterized algorithms.
- Conducted empirical analysis using the YAHPO gym for benchmarking, providing insights into the efficiency and robustness of the model.
