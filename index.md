I'm a B.Sc student in Computer Science at the University of Trento. I've been working at **Fondazione Bruno Kessler** (FBK) as a **Junior Data Scientist**, focusing on the application of **Machine Learning** to bioimaging and natural language processing and the development of cloud-based framework for large scale dataset analysis.
