## Things to do/avoid

Avoid killset (with proficency levels, like bars).

Add papers (articles) just if they are related to software development.

Avoid to show resume in the first page, so add before projects, then in another page resume.

Main links to add:

- Github
- Linkedin
- Resume

Links to avoid:

- Instagram
- Facebook
- Stack overflow (it isn't useful to know the problems I have while programming)

Don't put location in the description, just in the bottom.

# Projects page (if it exists)

Split page in two. In the left part put picture and in the right part the text.

Put the first 3 projects of the resume in the same order with links to check them out and a little sample if possible.

Don't write "making projects from cratch" (in project description).

Add website page for a specific project just in case there isn't a specific page dedicated to it, so if I make a website and it has its own page, don't make another page just to explain it.

# Resume / CV

Name and surname

Avoid putting forein languages when looking for a software developer job, english is obvious and
